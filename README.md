# Lab 8 - Starter

1. Within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed
   - Automated tests should happen anytime code gets pushed to ensure that the automation can be triggered based on the event of pushing a branch to our GitHub. If we want to manually run them instead, then it would not be automatically done for us which defeat the purpose of automation testing. If we run all the tests after all development is completed, we do not include software testing in the development pipeline, thus does not follow CI/CD pipeline principles and iterative testing in the Agile process. 
2. No, since end to end testing involves testing that coincides with user actions from start to finish, it would not be ideal to use an E2E test to simply check a function output, a unit test would be better suitable for such a test.
3. No, since the message feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user, that would be testing the message features functionalities at the feature level. Unit testing would rather test the message send functionaliy, and the message write functionality seperately as opposed to the message feature as a whole and their interactions with eachother (i.e how write and sending a message interact with eachother)
4. Yes, since unit testing executes quickly for individual components of our code, it would be ideal to test a component such as max length of a message since it does not extend past the feature or application level, and is a part of the message feature that can be encapsulated easily as one test unit as a check that ensures the max length will not exceed 80 characters in our message feature.
